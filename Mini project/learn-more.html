        <p class="yapping">Losing personal belongings is a common and frustrating experience for Most of  Us. Current solutions for finding lost items are fragmented, inefficient, and fail to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform.
            
            We introduce "FindMyStuff," a website that allows users to upload any missing objects that they have found and search for lost stuff. It has a user-friendly interface and very detailed filtration. It works on the virtual volunteering of netizens.
